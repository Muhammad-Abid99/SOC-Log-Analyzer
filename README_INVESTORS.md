## ðŸš¨ Problem
Security Operations Centers (SOCs) face **massive volumes** of Windows Event Logs daily.  
Manual review is **slow, error-prone, and costly**, delaying threat response, investigation, and compliance reporting.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Our Solution
**SOC-Log-Analyzer** is a **production-ready, MVP cybersecurity tool** that:

- **Parses** raw `.evtx` files into structured CSV in seconds.
- **Detects** multiple high-risk threats instantly:
  - Brute force logons
  - New user account creation
  - Privileged logons
  - Off-hours unusual activity
  - Account lockouts
- **Generates professional multi-format reports**:
  - **Text** â€“ SOC quick-read with ASCII severity bars
  - **HTML** â€“ management-friendly executive summaries
  - **PDF** â€“ compliance-ready, timestamped, and board-ready

---

## âœ¨ v0.5.0 Highlights
- **Contextualized `report_text.py`** â€“ includes account glossary & human/role-aware severity
- **Dynamic severity scoring** (off-hours, anomalous activity, correlated incidents)
- **Technical Appendix** â€“ analyst deep-dives for decision justification
- **Correlated Incidents Fusion** â€“ e.g., failed logons + privileged â†’ High
- **Enhanced MITRE ATT&CK mapping** (4624/4625/4672/4720 â†’ T1078.004/T1136)
- Preserves function signature & downstream compatibility for seamless integration

---

## ðŸ“Š Why Itâ€™s Different
- **Real-world focused** â€“ built for operational SOC teams, not a toy project
- **Accurate timestamps** â€“ every grouped alert shows *First Seen* & *Last Seen*
- **Scalable architecture** â€“ integrates with SIEMs (Splunk, ELK) and AI/ML-driven anomaly detection
- **Human-centric alerts** â€“ prioritizes off-hours & anomalous activity for faster SOC response
